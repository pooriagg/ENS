Ethereum-Name-Service
=====================

If someone wants to send some ether or nft or token to your account he must exacly know your 20 bytes address (+0x) which it has 40 characters and if he enters a single wrong letter all that funds will lost forever thus you can use ENS to easily solve this problem by the way it is hard to remeber it for yourself too, expamle:

> Lets say that account `0xeF3Eb741Eb840704C111C9d690f3db18ee3940A6` domain's is `alice.eth` 

instead of sending funds to this address `0xeF3Eb741Eb840704C111C9d690f3db18ee3940A6` you can use the relevant domain `alice.eth` as you can see it is so simple and clean and so easy to remember.
